**ECE 57000 AI Project: Molecular Dynamics Simulation using LSTMs**

This project implements the approach by Tsai et al. (2020) for generating molecular dynamics data using a language model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

**Key Components**

* **Langevin Dynamics Simulation (lvd.py):**  Implements the simulation for generating molecular dynamics data.
* **LSTM Model (IPYNB file):** Contains the LSTM model architecture and training logic used to learn from the generated data.

**Purpose**

This project serves as a learning resource and potential starting point for:

* **Understanding LSTM-based molecular dynamics simulation:** Explore how LSTMs can be applied to model complex molecular systems.
* **Replicating and extending Tsai et al.'s work:** Use this implementation as a base to test variations or introduce new elements.
* **AI in Computational Chemistry:** Contribute to the expanding use of  artificial intelligence techniques within  computational chemistry.
